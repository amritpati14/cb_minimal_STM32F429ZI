Minimal sample project for an STM32F429ZI in codeblocks
=========================================

* runs on windows only at the moment (only one post-build-command needs windows cmd, you can easily modify it by yourself)
* Base CMSIS and STM32F4xx_HAL code used from STM32CubeMX. Copyright to them...
